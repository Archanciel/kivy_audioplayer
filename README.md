# Kivy audio player
MP3 audio player Kivy interface application. This project has two purposes: 

- first, to demonstrate how to create a new Kivy class with sub-classes,
- second, to share a working mp3 file play editor.

## Required libraries
- kivy 2.0
- ffpyplayer 4.3.2 (if not installed, kivy SoundLoader seek() not working !)
